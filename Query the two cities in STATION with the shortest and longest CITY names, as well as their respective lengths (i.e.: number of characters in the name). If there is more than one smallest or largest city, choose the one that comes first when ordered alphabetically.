Query the two cities in STATION with the shortest and longest CITY names, as well as their respective lengths (i.e.: number of characters in the name). If there is more than one smallest or largest city, choose the one that comes first when ordered alphabetically.


(SELECT CITY, LENGTH(CITY) as len
FROM STATION 
ORDER BY LENGTH(CITY), CITY
LIMIT 1)
UNION
(SELECT CITY, LENGTH(CITY) as len
FROM STATION 
ORDER BY LENGTH(CITY) DESC, CITY
LIMIT 1)
ORDER BY len, CITY


SELECT CITY, len
FROM (
    SELECT CITY, LENGTH(CITY) as len,
           RANK() OVER (ORDER BY LENGTH(CITY)) as min_rnk,
           RANK() OVER (ORDER BY LENGTH(CITY) DESC) as max_rnk
    FROM STATION
) sub
WHERE min_rnk = 1 OR max_rnk = 1
ORDER BY len, CITY
